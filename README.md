# Deep Image Colorization for Structural Analysis of Aluminum Microstructures

This project introduces a novel deep learning framework that uses image colorization via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict the strain field components of aluminum microstructures. It offers a faster and comparably accurate alternative to traditional Finite Element Analysis (FEA) tools for microstructural materials modeling.

## ðŸ“Œ Description

Structural analysis is a critical step in the engineering design process, enabling engineers to predict how materials and components will perform under various loading conditions. At the microstructural level, such analysis becomes even more important, as the internal structure of materials like aluminum can significantly influence their macroscopic mechanical properties. 

Traditional tools such as CAD and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software, while powerful, are often computationally expensive and time-consumingâ€”especially when applied to complex microstructuresâ€”ultimately slowing down the iterative design and innovation cycle. 

This project presents a deep neural network (DNN)-based approach that leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image colorization of aluminum microstructures. By doing so, it aims to accelerate the simulation and analysis process without compromising accuracy, offering a more efficient alternative to conventional FEA methods in microstructural material modeling.

## Setting and Hypothesis
This approach treats a microstructure containing porosity defects as a grayscale input image and uses image colorization techniques to predict the three strain field componentsâ€”âˆŠxx,âˆŠyy, and âˆŠxy â€”which are represented as the red, green, and blue (RGB) output channels, respectively, as shown in the following figure
